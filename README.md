# Gir House Trophy Winning Timeline

A scroll-driven React application that tells the story of Gir House's competitive journey across fest cycles in the IIT Madras BS Degree program.

## Core Idea

This feature documents and explains Gir House's evolution from a competitive participant to a consistently dominant house. It emphasizes:

* Consistency across fests (Saavan, Margazhi, Paradox)
* Momentum building across cycles
* Repeated dominance when it occurs

## Narrative Arc

1. **Contender Phase** — Gir House consistently placing well but not at the top.
2. **Breakthrough Phase** — First House Trophy win at Paradox 2024.
3. **Dominance Phase** — Back-to-back trophy wins and #1 rankings.

## Technology Stack

* **Framework**: React 19 + Vite
* **Language**: TypeScript
* **Animations**: CSS transitions + Scroll-driven state
* **Styling**: CSS Modules with design tokens

## Running Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
